Tomcat provider for Users and groups management services
========================================================

Introduction
------------
The classes from this package contains the users and groups management service implementations for Apache Tomcat.              

This provider supports realm types based on XML files (the default ones in Tomcat server), such as `tomcat-users.xml.                                 

* The users management services implementations are provided by class `org.uberfire.ext.security.management.tomcat.TomcatUserManagementService`.              
* The concrete users management service implementation is provided by class `org.uberfire.ext.security.management.tomcat.TomcatUserManager`, that **binds the Tomcat users for the given realm into application users**.                   
* The concrete roles management service implementation is provided by class `org.uberfire.ext.security.management.tomcat.TomcatGroupManager`, that **binds the Tomcat roles for the given realm into application groups**.                   


Installation notes
------------------

**Apache Tomcat**
If you are deploying the application in an Apache Tomcat, you can exclude the following libraries as they are provided by Tomcat's default library.

                        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
                        <artifactId>tomcat-catalina</artifactId>
                </dependency>
                
                <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>

                </dependency>

**Other containers**
If you are deploying the application in other containers different than Tomcat, please make sure the following dependencies are in your application's classpath:                     

                <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
                        <artifactId>tomcat-catalina</artifactId>
                        <version>7.0.61</version>
                </dependency>
                
                <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
                        <artifactId>tomcat-coyote</artifactId>
                        <version>7.0.61</version>
                </dependency>
                
                <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
                        <artifactId>tomcat-util</artifactId>
                        <version>7.0.61</version>
                </dependency>


Usage
-----
To use this provider implementation for the users and groups management services, please choose one of the following options:               

a) Specify the concrete provider to use by adding a properties file named `security-management.properties` in your web application root classpath. 
(e.g. `src/main/resources/security-management.properties`), with the following keys and your concrete provider name as value:                               

    org.uberfire.ext.security.management.api.userManagementServices=TomcatUserManagementService

b) Specify the following Java system properties at container startup:        

    -Dorg.uberfire.ext.security.management.api.userManagementServices=TomcatUserManagementService

In order to use this provider, the following system properties are required to be present at startup:                 

* `org.uberfire.ext.security.management.tomcat.catalina-base` - The filesystem's path for the Tomcat's base directory (CATALINA_BASE). By default it's read from the system properties, so running tomcat aready provides it. It is mandatory. Defaults to: `/opt/tomcat`.                  
* `org.uberfire.ext.security.management.tomcat.users-file` - The Tomcat's users XML file path relative to the previous given value for `org.uberfire.ext.security.management.tomcat.catalina-base` . Property is mandatory. Defaults to: `conf/tomcat-users.xml`.                  

If you use the default Tomcat realm's configuration, you don't have to specify any of the above system properties, as the default values provided works with Tomcat's defaults.
