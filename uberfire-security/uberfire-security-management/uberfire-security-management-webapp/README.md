Users and groups management services - Web Application
======================================================

This module provides a simple UF application with the *Users and groups management perspective*. You can test the user system related services, screens and widgets here.                                

Login into the application using the following credentials: `admin/admin`.                         

By default, this webapp uses the Wildfly's users management service provider implementation. So the users and groups managed in the webapp are the ones present in the local wildfly installation.
